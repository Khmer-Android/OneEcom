# Design Description

General guideline of how designs, styles and themes are/should be created

### Guidelines

* Use [Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/tool-attributes) attributes as much as possible. This is done so that once can see the any page design or component without dependent on running the application
* Use Material Design Components (MDC) instead of AppCompat Theme(s) / Widget(s) / Component(s)
